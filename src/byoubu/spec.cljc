  `problems` returns a vector of human-readable strings rather than throwing,
  so a test can report every fault in a new backdrop at once instead of one
  per run. The legibility check is part of validation, not a separate lint:
  a backdrop whose own recommended ink fails AA on its own content band is
  malformed in the same sense as one missing a palette key."
