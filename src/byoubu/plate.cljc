  "Tier-0 plate: the backdrop as pure gradient data, no assets.

  A backdrop ships in three tiers (docs/adr/0001-byoubu.md):

    T0  this namespace — layered gradients derived from the palette. About
        a kilobyte, paints on first frame, works with no network, no GPU,
        no WebGPU support, and under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
    T1  a rendered poster (still) — the literal scene.
    T2  the live WebGPU scene through the kami stack.

  T0 is deliberately *not* a picture of dunes: CSS gradients cannot draw a
  ridge line, and pretending otherwise produces the muddy blobs that make
  gradient backgrounds look cheap. What it reproduces faithfully is the part
  that governs legibility — the vertical light structure of the scene
  (zenith, horizon glow, ground fall-off, vignette). Content placed on T0
  and content placed on T2 sit on the same luminance, so nothing shifts when
  the higher tier loads.

  Layers are returned as data, not CSS strings. byoubu-ui turns them into a
  `background-image` stack via css.core; tests assert against the layer maps
  directly. This is the same reason liquid-glass-ui keeps its rules as EDN:
  a string fragment can be silently malformed, a value cannot."
