  "Portable color math for backdrop facts: hex parsing, WCAG relative
  luminance and contrast ratio, and weighted mixing in sRGB.

  Why this lives here and not in a UI library: the whole point of the
  catalog is that a backdrop can state *what it does to legibility* before
  anything renders. That claim has to be computed from the palette itself,
  by code with no dependency on CSS, the DOM, or a design system — otherwise
  the number is just an assertion someone typed.

  Zero deps, pure functions, portable CLJ/CLJS. Reader conditionals are used
  only for `Math/pow` (WCAG's 2.4 gamma), which has no portable spelling."
