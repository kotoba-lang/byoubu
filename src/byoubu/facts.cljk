  "Legibility facts derived from a backdrop's palette.

  This is the namespace that makes the catalog worth more than a folder of
  videos. A distributed background asset says nothing about what may be put
  on top of it; every consumer re-guesses the text color, the accent, and
  how opaque the panels need to be, and gets it wrong at least once. Here
  those answers are *computed* from the palette — deterministically, with no
  renderer and no browser — and the computation is testable, so a backdrop
  that would make body text unreadable fails a test instead of shipping.

  Everything is a pure function of the backdrop map, so facts cannot drift
  from the palette they describe: there is no stored copy to forget to
  update."

  `:tier-contrasts` reports them individually so a caller can see which tier

  `:appearance` follows the ink, not the luminance threshold directly: the
