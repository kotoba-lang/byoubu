  "Tier 1: render a `:byoubu/scene` to a deterministic SVG poster.

  Why SVG and not a bitmap. The workspace 3D rule (CLAUDE.md) makes WebGPU /
  WebGL 2.0 the authoritative renderer and permits DOM/SVG only for
  \"非3D overlay、diagram、thumbnail、明示された degraded fallback\". A T1
  poster is exactly a thumbnail/fallback, so SVG is in bounds — and it buys
  three things a PNG would not: the output is text (diffable, reviewable in a
  PR, no binary in git and therefore no B2/DataLad dataset needed at this
  tier), it is resolution-independent, and it is byte-reproducible from the
  seed. T2 — the live scene — stays WebGPU through the kami stack.

  Why this lives under `render/` and not `src/`. It requires
  `kotoba-lang/terrain`, which pulls `kotoba-lang/compiler`. Nothing a browser
  loads may inherit that, so this path is on the `:render` alias only. The
  posters it writes land in `resources/`, which `src/` may read about through
  the generated `byoubu.poster` manifest.

  The ridge and dune silhouettes come from `terrain.noise/fbm-noise` — the
  real library the scene spec names, not a second noise implementation. That
  is the whole point of describing scenes in the kami stack's vocabulary."
